> This project explores the concept of Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and demonstrates how to implement it by using Docker to containerize MySQL replication. The system utilizes a load-balancing technique to distribute the workload between multiple slave database servers for read operations, while maintaining a single master server for write operations.
